<h1>Don't get it complicated!</h1>

Small iPhone app that, basically, helps to solve several needs I have quite often: tracking my expenses on small trips / holiday trips and even tracking general monthly expenses.

• Track your trip expenses or daily expenses easily… and fast!

• Get the expense location automatically added.

• Add as many places and categories as you may need.

• Get the stats for a given trip or grouped by a common place, and see how these balance with a given budget.

• Review in the Map all the visited places for a given trip… or for all the trips in a given Place!

• Localized in English, Spanish, French and German.
